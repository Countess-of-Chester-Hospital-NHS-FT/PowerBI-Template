# PowerBI-Template

We have developed this template to:
* Save us time when developing new KPI dashboards
* Ensure all our dashboards have a similar look and feel to enhance usability
* Enhance our ability to work collaboratively on dashboards
* Facilitate all metrics being available in SPC charts as per the Making Data Count agenda
* Be both as flexible and as compact as possible (allow many different metrics/timescales/comparisons to be made with the minimum number of pages/charts)

### Repo structure
* PowerBI template file is in repository root
* Note this repo isn't properly git version controlled - just contains the latest version of the template for dissemination purposes
